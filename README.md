DETERMINING DEGREES OF SEPARATION IN NETWORKS
Six degrees of separation is a concept which states that all human beings are six or fewer social connections away from each other. In other words, any inhabitant of the Earth could meet anyone in the world with a maximum of six or fewer mutual connections between them and another person, be it through acquaintances, friends, or members of their family. The idea is popular in random networks, as Watts and Strogatz showed that the average path length between two nodes in a random network is equal to (ln N / ln K), where N = total nodes and K = acquaintances per node. 
For example, if N = 6,000,000,000 (90% of the World population) and K = 30 then Degrees of Separation = 22.5 / 3.4 = 6.6. 

The concept aims to answer the question of how closely linked two members of a social network are to each other. The concept is also useful in tracing genetic disorders, by establishing the proximity of two members on a family tree of their common ancestry. Knowing that two members are very closely related to one another will aid in predicting the possibility of transmission of a hereditary trait or gene with a high likelihood of mutation. This idea is also useful in studying the spread of epidemics, by examining social networks during contact tracing. Internet networks are reliant on hyperlinks connecting one webpage to another, thereby creating a highly-interconnected web of nodes (representing webpages) and edges (representing hyperlinks). Knowledge regarding the degrees of separation between a webpage and a popular website (a hub node in the network) is essential for search engine optimization. Enterprises can benefit greatly by establishing proximity in the internet network to popular search engines such as Yahoo, Google, etc.

Another major use case is to find how closely linked two Facebook users are. In a world where social media is used for staying connected with each other as well as staying updated with news, we can estimate the social proximity of two users by calculating the degrees of separation between them in the social network. Here, social proximity refers to how closely linked two users are in the social network. The lesser the degrees of separation between two users, the more their social proximity as fewer steps are required for them to connect with each other. This means that closely-linked users are more likely to send/accept connection requests to each other, and may even have similar interests. This information is crucial for increasing engagement as well as targeting advertisements related to these similar interests to the given users.

The project aims to determine the number of steps (or edges) between two given members of the network. The dataset, consisting of users and their connections, is represented in the form of a graph where each user forms a node and the nodes are connected based on the connections of the users that they represent. A graph database will be used for storing this dataset due to its flexibility in terms of data storage and query mechanisms. Given two users, the application will output the number of edges between the two users in the shortest path between them. The project also aims to optimize the time required to perform this computation, and aims to efficiently store the voluminous dataset to allow for faster querying.
